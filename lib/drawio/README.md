These files are only here to allow vscode to provide intellisense and detect obvious mistakes in our plugin script. They do NOT need to be distributed.

Why some files in here minified and others normal? Because draw.io only provides certain core files as minified. See https://github.com/adamfk/drawio-src-extractor

files are last updated from https://github.com/adamfk/drawio/releases/tag/v20.8.3

minified files from: https://github.com/adamfk/drawio-src-extractor/commit/f0f14555671eee3bd7c923b7d166cf4c47d85bed
